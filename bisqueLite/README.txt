PLEASE REFER TO THE ABOUT PAGE FOR MORE DETAILS ON BISQUE LITE.

Also, please note the following:

BISQUE Lite's conversion method has the following signature:
	convert_input(input, output, input_mutation = None, input_position = None, extras = {'best':None, 'all':None, 'specific':None})

This contrasts with BISQUE full's conversion method, as there is no argument for input type. Also, BISQUE Lite outputs dictionaries which DO NOT include 'type'.
